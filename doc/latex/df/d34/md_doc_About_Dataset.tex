This dataset was constructed to support participants in the Netflix Prize. See \href{http://www.netflixprize.com}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+netflixprize.\+com}} for details about the prize.

The movie rating files contain over 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomly-\/chosen, anonymous Netflix customers over 17 thousand movie titles. The data were collected between October, 1998 and December, 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received during this period. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 (integral) stars. To protect customer privacy, each customer id has been replaced with a randomly-\/assigned id. The date of each rating and the title and year of release for each movie id are also provided.\hypertarget{md_doc_About_Dataset_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{USAGE LICENSE}\label{md_doc_About_Dataset_autotoc_md20}

The file \char`\"{}training\+\_\+set.\+tar\char`\"{} is a tar of a directory containing 17770 files, one per movie. The first line of each file contains the movie id followed by a colon. Each subsequent line in the file corresponds to a rating from a customer and its date in the following format\+:

Customer\+ID,\mbox{\hyperlink{structRating}{Rating}},Date


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Movie\+IDs}} range from 1 to 17770 sequentially.
\item {\bfseries{Customer\+IDs}} range from 1 to 2649429, with gaps. There are 480189 users.
\item {\bfseries{Ratings}} are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.
\item {\bfseries{Dates}} have the format {\ttfamily YYYY-\/\+MM-\/\+DD}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_doc_About_Dataset_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysection{MOVIES FILE DESCRIPTION}\label{md_doc_About_Dataset_autotoc_md22}
\mbox{\hyperlink{structMovie}{Movie}} information in \char`\"{}movie\+\_\+titles.\+txt\char`\"{} is in the following format\+:

Movie\+ID,Year\+Of\+Release,Title


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Movie\+ID}} do not correspond to actual Netflix movie ids or IMDB movie ids.
\item {\bfseries{Year\+Of\+Release}} can range from 1890 to 2005 and may correspond to the release of corresponding DVD, not necessarily its theaterical release.
\item {\bfseries{Title}} is the Netflix movie title and may not correspond to titles used on other sites. Titles are in English.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_doc_About_Dataset_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysection{QUALIFYING AND PREDICTION DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION}\label{md_doc_About_Dataset_autotoc_md23}
The qualifying dataset for the Netflix Prize is contained in the text file \char`\"{}qualifying.\+txt\char`\"{}. It consists of lines indicating a movie id, followed by a colon, and then customer ids and rating dates, one per line for that movie id. The movie and customer ids are contained in the training set. Of course the ratings are withheld. There are no empty lines in the file.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{MovieID1:}
\DoxyCodeLine{CustomerID11,Date11}
\DoxyCodeLine{CustomerID12,Date12}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{MovieID2:}
\DoxyCodeLine{CustomerID21,Date21}
\DoxyCodeLine{CustomerID22,Date22}

\end{DoxyCode}


For the Netflix Prize, your program must predict the all ratings the customers gave the movies in the qualifying dataset based on the information in the training dataset.

The format of your submitted prediction file follows the movie and customer id, date order of the qualifying dataset. However, your predicted rating takes the place of the corresponding customer id (and date), one per line.

For example, if the qualifying dataset looked like\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{111:}
\DoxyCodeLine{3245,2005-\/12-\/19}
\DoxyCodeLine{5666,2005-\/12-\/23}
\DoxyCodeLine{6789,2005-\/03-\/14}
\DoxyCodeLine{225:}
\DoxyCodeLine{1234,2005-\/05-\/26}
\DoxyCodeLine{3456,2005-\/11-\/07}

\end{DoxyCode}


then a prediction file should look something like\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{111:}
\DoxyCodeLine{3.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{3.4}
\DoxyCodeLine{4.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{225:}
\DoxyCodeLine{1.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{2.0}

\end{DoxyCode}


which predicts that customer {\ttfamily 3245} would have rated movie {\ttfamily 111} {\ttfamily 3.\+0} stars on the {\ttfamily 19th of Decemeber, 2005}, that customer {\ttfamily 5666} would have rated it slightly higher at {\ttfamily 3.\+4} stars on the {\ttfamily 23rd of Decemeber, 2005}, etc.

You must make predictions for all customers for all movies in the qualifying dataset.\hypertarget{md_doc_About_Dataset_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{THE PROBE DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION}\label{md_doc_About_Dataset_autotoc_md24}
To allow you to test your system before you submit a prediction set based on the qualifying dataset, we have provided a probe dataset in the file \char`\"{}probe.\+txt\char`\"{}. This text file contains lines indicating a movie id, followed by a colon, and then customer ids, one per line for that movie id.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{MovieID1:}
\DoxyCodeLine{CustomerID11}
\DoxyCodeLine{CustomerID12}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{MovieID2:}
\DoxyCodeLine{CustomerID21}
\DoxyCodeLine{CustomerID22}

\end{DoxyCode}


Like the qualifying dataset, the movie and customer id pairs are contained in the training set. However, unlike the qualifying dataset, the ratings (and dates) for each pair are contained in the training dataset.

If you wish, you may calculate the RMSE of your predictions against those ratings and compare your RMSE against the Cinematch RMSE on the same data. See \href{http://www.netflixprize.com/faq\#probe}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+netflixprize.\+com/faq\#probe}} for that value.
